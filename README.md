# multiomic-cooccurences

This repository holds the analysis scripts and cystic fibrosis datasets to showcase the utility of applying neural networks to learn multi-omics cooccurences.

# Run scripts



The command used to generate the cystic fibrosis occurences is found under the scripts folder. This was a result of multiple rounds of cross validation with parameters with learning rates (1e-5, 1e-6, 1e-7), input priors (0.1, 1, 10),  output priors (0.1, 1, 10) and a rank of 3.

When running these commands, it will take a substantial amount of compute time, so be sure to allocate multiple days to run.
It is also recommended to run Tensorboard in parallel in order to monitor the convergence of the algorithm.
